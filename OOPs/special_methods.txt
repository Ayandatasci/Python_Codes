Magic or dunder (double underscore) methods in Python are special methods 
with predefined names surrounded by double underscores, such as `__init__`, `__str__`,
etc., that enable customization of class behavior and provide functionality 
like object initialization, string representation, operator overloading, and more.

Examples:
- `__init__`: Initializes an object when it is created.
- `__str__`: Returns a string representation of the object.
- `__add__`: Enables addition of objects using the `+` operator.
- `__len__`: Returns the length of the object.
- `__eq__`: Checks for equality between objects using the `==` operator.

These examples showcase the usage of magic methods for specific purposes, but there 
are many more magic methods available in Python for various functionalities and 
customizations.
