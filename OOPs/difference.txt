Static Method:
Belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
Does not have access to the instance or its attributes.
Can be called directly on the class itself, without the need for an instance.
Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.
Commonly used for utility functions that do not depend on the instance or its state.


Class Method:
Belongs to the class and has access to class-level attributes.
Cannot access instance-specific attributes directly.
Can be called on both the class and its instances.
Defined using the @classmethod decorator.
Often used for methods that require interaction with class-level data or when creating alternative constructors.


Instance Method:
Belongs to an instance of the class.
Has access to instance-specific attributes and methods.
Must be called on an instance of the class.
Defined without any specific decorators.
Used for most regular methods that operate on instance data and behavior.
